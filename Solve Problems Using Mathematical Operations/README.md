**Question 1**<br/>

Assume that you are hired to develop application software which is designed specifically for
the Computer Programming course. The application software will be used among the lecturers who taught the course.
The application software should be able to calculate the total marks accumulated by each student registered for the course.
In order to calculate the total marks, the lecturer need to input the marks obtained by each student for First Test,
Second Test, Assignments, and Final Examination. The following is the distribution of percentages taken for the calculation of the total mark:

â€¢ First Test will take 20%. The full mark for the test is 50.<br/>
â€¢ Second Test will take 20%. The full mark for the test is 50.<br/>
â€¢ Assignments will take 30%. The full mark for the assignment is 90.<br/>
â€¢ Final Examination will take 30%. The full mark for the examination is 100.<br/>

The application software shall display all the marks for each evaluation, including total marks in 100%.<br/>

**For Questions 2 and 3, develop the pre-programming phase (PAC, IPO, flowchart, and
pseudocode) before implementing the Java program.**<br/>

**Question 2**<br/>

Write a program to calculate the volume of a triangle and ask the user for the following:<br/>
â€¢ The base value in cm<br/>
â€¢ The height value in cm<br/>
â€¢ The length value in cm<br/><br/>

Once these items have been entered, the program should calculate and display the following:<br/>
â€¢ The area of the triangle<br/>
â€¢ The volume of the triangle<br/><br/>

**Note:**<br/>
Area = Â½ x base x height<br/>
Volume = area x length<br/><br/>

**Sample run:**<br/>
_Enter the base value: 4 [enter]<br/>
Enter the height value: 3 [enter]<br/>
The area of a triangle is 6 cm2<br/>
Enter the length value: 10 [enter]<br/>
The volume of a triangle is 60 cm3_<br/>

**Question 3**<br/>

The program below requests the user to enter the distance to drive, the fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon,<br/>
and the price per gallon then display the cost of the trip.<br/>

**Sample run:**<br/>
_Enter the driving distance: 900.5<br/>
Enter miles per gallon: 25.5<br/>
Enter price per gallon: 3.55<br/>
The cost of driving is RM125.36_<br/>
