For both questions, implement the pre-programming phase before developing the program using Java.

**Question 1**

The Fleurs Floral Company sells bouquet of flowers to customers. The customer will get more discounts if he/she spends more. Compute the final amount a customer must pay after a discount is given. The following are the discounts given to the customer:<br/>

amount >= RM150 and < RM600 discount = 10%<br/>
amount >= RM600 discount = 15%<br/>
