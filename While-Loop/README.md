For both questions, implement only the pseudocode before developing the Java program.
**Question 1**<br/>
Write a program that asks the user to enter today’s sales for five stores. The program should display a bar chart comparing each other store’s sales. Create each bar in the bar chart by displaying a row of asterisks. Each asterisk should represent RM100 of sales.<br/><br/>
_**Sample run:**_<br/>
Enter today’s sales for store 1: 1000 [enter]<br/>
Enter today’s sales for store 2: 1200 [enter]<br/>
Enter today’s sales for store 3: 1800 [enter]<br/>
Enter today’s sales for store 4: 800 [enter]<br/>
Enter today’s sales for store 5: 1900 [enter]<br/><br/>
**SALES BAR CHART**<br/>
Store 1: **********<br/>
Store 2: ************<br/>
Store 3: ******************<br/>
Store 4: ********<br/>
Store 5: *******************<br/><br/>
Input validation: You may use any value to stop the loop. This question may require the use of while loop with an if statement.<br/><br/>
**Question 2**<br/><br/>
Write a program that asks the user for a positive non-zero integer value. The program should use a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. <br/><br/>
For example, if the user enters 50, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,…..,20.<br/><br/>
**Sample run:**<br/>
Enter any positive number: 20 [enter]<br/>
Total sum for all integers between 1 and 20 is 210.<br/>
Input validation: You may use any negative value or zero value to stop the loop.<br/><br/>
