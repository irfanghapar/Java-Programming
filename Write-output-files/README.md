**Question 1**

Write a program to create two files. The input file should be opened for reading and the output file should be opened for writing. The program should read the contents of the input file (matric no and names of students with five test scores) and store the matric numbers, names and results (average of five test scores with its corresponding grade) in the output file. Close both files when you are done using them.

**Note**: Input file must exists and contain data before you can read from the file. You may create up to 20 records of students in the input file.
